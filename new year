Freud (Psychoanalysis): May you have the courage to face the truth and the strength to welcome everything in the new year. 

Adler (Individual Psychology): May you accept the true fact that life inherently lacks meaning, and find ease in every moment of dedication and focus.

Martin Seligman (Positive Psychology): I hope you can always see what you have, and never feel that there is nothing worth cherishing!

Rogers (Humanistic): Wish you understand that life is a flowing and changing process, and may you let go of the impulse to arrange everything in the new year.
